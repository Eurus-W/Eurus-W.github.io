I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) advised by Prof. [Yun Chen](yunc.me), specializing in large language models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. I obtained my bachelor's degree from SUFE in 2022. From September 2023 to January 2025, I worked as a research intern at THUNLP & QY Lab, under the supervision of [Shuo Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5vm5yAMAAAAJ&hl=en). I have published several papers in top conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL and NeurIPS.
